# Testing Strategy for Interview Prep App

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Scope**: Individual functions, components, and services
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Utility functions (like PDF parsing)
  - Form validations
  - State management
  - Component rendering

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Scope**: Multiple components working together, service interactions
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, MSW
- **Coverage Target**: Key user flows
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Form submissions
  - Authentication flows
  - Data fetching and display
  - State transitions

### 3. End-to-End Testing

- **Scope**: Complete user journeys through the application
- **Tools**: Cypress
- **Coverage Target**: Critical user paths
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Authentication
  - Profile creation
  - Practice sessions
  - Job management

### 4. User Testing

- **Scope**: Usability and user experience
- **Methods**: Guided tasks with feedback forms
- **Participants**: 5-8 potential users per round
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Task completion rates
  - User confusion points
  - Feature suggestions

## Test Case Design

### 1. Functional Testing

- Each feature must have positive and negative test cases
- Edge cases must be identified and tested
- Cross-browser compatibility tests for UI components

### 2. Non-Functional Testing

- Performance testing for API interactions and rendering
- Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
- Responsive design testing across device sizes

### 3. Security Testing

- Authentication and authorization
- Form validation and input sanitization
- API security

## Test Implementation Priority

1. **Critical Path Tests** (P0)

   - User registration and login
   - Profile creation
   - Practice session flow
   - Answer saving and retrieval

2. **Core Functionality Tests** (P1)

   - Job management
   - Answer feedback
   - Filtering and searching

3. **Enhancement Tests** (P2)
   - Profile beautification
   - Tags and categories
   - User preferences

## Test Data Management

- Mock data for authentication and APIs
- Test user accounts with different states
- Database seeding for E2E tests

## Test Automation

- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Automated running of unit and integration tests on each PR
- Daily E2E test runs on staging environment
- Test report generation and tracking

## Test Schedule

- Unit tests: Run on every PR
- Integration tests: Run on every PR
- E2E tests: Run nightly on staging
- User testing: Conducted before major releases

## Ongoing Testing

- Regression test suite maintenance
- Test coverage tracking
- Bug-driven test additions

## Running Tests

### Unit & Integration Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/components/auth/__tests__/LoginBasic.test.tsx

# Run tests by pattern
npm test -- -t "renders login form"

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverageF
